Implements All map generation requirements with basic pathing generation. Commeneted code is
for debugging, ease of use, and the remains of my attempt at dijksta's algorithm for generating a path.

HW2:
    All commands implemented and working as of 2/7/23.
    NOTES:
        Map is opposite: (-200, -200) maps to upper left corner
        Occasionally a malloc() error will occur on startup or during traversal. i looked into it and apparently it's to do with how malloc calls other functions and i'm not sure how to fix it.
    Moves that go past map borders just set uyou at the map at that border.
    Chance of buildings appearing decreases as you move out until +/-100, where it is locked at 5%.
    Gates match up when they are generate adjacently to an already generated map.
    No map is generated until it is visited.
    World borders have no exit on the side that borders the world edge.

HW3:
    Can generate starting map with no uissues and display proper maps
    NOTE:
        Displays Hiker then Rival Maps
    Malloc error still present.
    Program crashes if you try to move. Several TAs as well as the professor haven't been able to identify the cause.

HW4:
    All the errors of before x100
    NOTES:
        Characters sometimes flee instead of moving towards PC fsr (I think i figured this problem out)
        Characters sometimes teleport arround for no reason or skip turns.
        Will randomly stop or segfault in the middle of a run (idk why)
    All trianers have a random chance to spayn barring hiker and rival which will spawn if numtrainers >= 2
